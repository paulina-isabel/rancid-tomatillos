## Abstract: 
This application is designed to give users a page to view the ratings of movies from the years 2020-2022. On the landing page, they see a brief welcome to the app, movie posters for each film as well as the year it was released and its rating out of ten stars. If the user would like more information about a particular movie, they can click on the image or title associated and be taken to a details page. This page contains a tagline, a description of the film, the full release date as well as the runtime. From here, users may navigate back to the homepage, with the click of the back arrow, to discover other movies!
